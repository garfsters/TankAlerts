Tank Alerts: Clean Water Monitoring System
Welcome to Tank Alerts, a comprehensive solution aimed at improving water quality and sanitation, particularly in urban environments like New York City. This GitHub repository hosts the project that combines research, interviews, and innovative technology to address issues related to clean water and sanitation.

Key Features:
- Research and Analysis: Delved into the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal for Clean Water and Sanitation to identify critical issues.
- Community Engagement: Conducted interviews and surveys with 23 individuals to gather insights into personal experiences with tap water in New York City.
- Application Development: Designed and developed Tank Alerts, a Figma-based application that notifies tenants about the quality of their water tanks.
- Hardware Prototyping: Engineered "The Piranha," a machine that interfaces with Tank Alerts to collect data from water samples and clean imperfections in water tanks. This technology aims to benefit residents of Jacob Riis NYCHA public housing.
